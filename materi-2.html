            <h5>PRESENT CONTINUOUS</h5>
            <p>The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense. The present continuous can also be used to show
                that an action is going to take place in the near future. Read on for detailed descriptions, examples, and present continuous exercises.</p>

            <h5>PRESENT CONTINUOUS FORMS</h5>
            <p>The present continuous is formed using<b><i> am/is/are + present participle.</i></b> Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and <i>am/is/are.</i> Negatives are made with <i>not.</i> </p>
            <li>Statement : You <b> are watching</b> TV.</li>
            <li>Question : <b>Are</b> you <b>watching</b> TV?</li>
            <li>Negative : You <b>are not watching</b> TV.</li>
            <p></p>

            <h5>
                <p></p>PRESENT CONTINUOUS USES</h5>
            <h6>USE 1 Now</h6>
            <p>Use the present continuous with <b>normal verbs</b> to express the idea that something is happening now, at this very moment. It can also be used to show that something is not happening now.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>You<b> are learning</b> English now.</li>
            <li>You<b> are not swimming</b> now.</li>
            <li><b>Are</b> you <b>sleeping?</b></li>
            <li>I <b>am sitting.</b></li>
            <li>I <b>am not standing.</b></li>
            <li>They <b>are reading </b>their books.</li>
            <li><b>Is </b>he <b>sitting </b>or <b>standing? </b></li>
            <li>What <b>are </b>you <b>doing?</b></li>
            <li>What <b>aren't </b>you <b>doing </b>your homework?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 2 Longer Actions in Progress Now</h6>
            <p>In English, "now" can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on. Sometimes, we use the present continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not
                be doing it at this exact second.</p>
            <p> Examples : (All of these sentences can be said while eating dinner in a restaurant.)</p>
            <li>I <b>am studying </b>to become a doctor.</li>
            <li>I <b>am not studying </b>to become a dentist.</li>
            <li><b>Are </b>you <b>working </b>on any spesial projects at work?</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Aren't </b>you <b>teaching </b>at the university now?</b>
            </li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 3 Near Future</h6>
            <p>Sometimes, speakers use the present continuous to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>I <b>am meeting </b>some friends after work.</li>
            <li>I <b>am not going</b> to the party tonight.</li>
            <li><b>Is </b>he <b>visiting </b>his parents next weekend?</li>
            <li><b>Isn't </b>he <b>coming </b>with us tonight?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 4 Repetition and Irritation with "Always"</h6>
            <p>The present continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like <b>simple present</b>, but with negative emotion. Remember to put the
                words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>She <b>is always coming </b>to class late.</li>
            <li>He <b>is constantly talking. </b>I wish he would shut up.</li>
            <li>I don't like them because they <b>are always complaining.</b></li>
            <p></p>

            <h5>
                <p></p>PRESENT CONTINUOUS TIPS</h5>
            <h6>REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</h6>
            <p>It is important to remember that non-continuous verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for mixed verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using present continuous with these verbs,
                you must use simple present.</p>
            <p>Examples : </p>
            <li>She <b>is loving </b>this chocolate ice cream. <b><i>Not Correct</i></b></li>
            <li>She <b>loves </b>this chocolate ice cream. <b><i>Correct</i></b></li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h6>
            <p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
            <p>Examples : </p>
            <li>You are <b>still </b>watching TV</li>
            <li>Are you <b>still </b>watching TV?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h6>
            <p>Examples : </p>
            <li>Right now, Tom <b>is writing  </b>the letter.<i> Active</i></li>
            <li>Right now, the letter <b>is being written </b>by Tom. <i>Passive</i></li>
            <p></p>

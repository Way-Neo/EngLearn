            <h5>SIMPLE PAST</h5>
            <p>The simple past (also called past simple, past indefinite or preterite) is a verb tense which is used to show that a completed action took place at a specific time in the past. The simple past is also frequently used to talk about past habits
                and generalizations. Read on for detailed descriptions, examples, and simple past exercises.</p>

            <h5>SIMPLE PAST FORMS</h5>
            <p>The simple past is formed using the <b>verb + ed</b>. In addition, there are many verbs with irregular past forms. Questions are made with <i>did</i> and negative forms are made with <i>did not</i>.</p>
            <li>Statement : You <b>called</b> Wahyu.</li>
            <li>Question : <b>Did</b> you <b>called</b> Wahyu?</li>
            <li>Negative : You <b>did not called</b> Wahyu.</li>
            <p></p>

            <h5>
                <p></p>SIMPLE PAST USES</h5>
            <h6>USE 1 Completed Action in the Past</h6>
            <p>Use the simple past to express the idea that an action started and finished at a specific time in the past. Sometimes, the speaker may not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>I <b>saw </b>a movie yesterday.</li>
            <li>I <b>didn't see</b> a play yesterday.</li>
            <li>Last year, I <b>traveled </b>to Singapore.</li>
            <li>Last year, I <b>didn't travel</b> to Dubai.</li>
            <li><b>Did </b>you <b>have </b>dinner last night?</li>
            <li>He <b>washed </b>his car.</li>
            <li>She <b>didn't wash </b>her car.</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 2 A Series of Completed Actions</h6>
            <p>We use the simple past to list a series of completed actions in the past. These actions happen 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>I <b>finished </b>work, <b>walked </b>to the beach, and <b>found </b>a nice place to dive.</li>
            <li>He <b>arrived </b>from the airport at 7 AM, <b>checked </b>into the hotel at 9 AM, and <b>met </b> the others at 10 AM.</li>
            <li><b>Did </b>you <b>add </b>flour, <b>pour </b>in the milk, and then <b>add</b> the eggs?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 3 Duration in the Past</h6>
            <p>The simple past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>I <b>lived </b>in Japan for three years.</li>
            <li>Ida <b>studied </b>Javanese for ten years.</li>
            <li>They <b>sat </b>at the corner of the class all day.</li>
            <li>They <b>did not stay </b>at the class the entire time.</li>
            <li>We <b>talked </b>on the phone for two hours.</li>
            <li>How long <b>did </b>you <b>wait </b>for them?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 4 Habits in the Past</h6>
            <p>The simple past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same meaning as "used to." To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never,
                when I was a child, when I was younger, etc.</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>I <b>studied </b>French when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>He <b>played </b>the bass.</li>
            <li>He <b>didn't play </b>the guitar.</li>
            <li>She <b>worked </b>at the movie theater after school.</li>
            <li>They never <b>went </b>to school, they always <b>skipped </b>class.</li>
            <li><b>Did </b>you <b>play </b>a musical instrument when you were a kid?</li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>USE 5 Past Facts or Generalizations</h6>
            <p>The simple past can also be used to describe past facts or generalizations which are no longer true. As in USE 4 above, this use of the simple past is quite similar to the expression "used to."</p>
            <p> Examples : </p>
            <li>She <b>was </b>shy as a child, but now she is very outgoing.</li>
            <li>He <b>didn't like </b>tomatoes before.</li>
            <li><b>Did </b>you <b>live </b>in Bali when you <b>were </b>a kid?</li>
            <li>People <b>paid </b>much more to make cell phone calls in the past.</li>
            <p></p>

            <h5>
                <p></p>SIMPLE PAST TIPS</h5>
            <h6>IMPORTANT When-Clauses Happen First</h6>
            <p>Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when I dropped my pen..." or "when class began..." These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very
                important. The examples below contain when-clauses.</p>
            <p>Examples : </p>
            <li><b>When I paid her ten thousand rupiahs</b>, she answered my questions.</li>
            <li>She answered my questions <b>when I paid her ten thousand rupiahs.</b></li>
            <p>When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the simple past. Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered my question. It is not important whether
                "when I paid her one dollar" is at the beginning of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning. First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.</p>
            <p>Example :</p>
            <li>I paid her ten thousand rupiahs <b>when she answered my questions.</b></li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h6>
            <p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc</p>
            <p>Examples :</p>
            <li>You <b>just  </b>called Xercival.<i> Active</i></li>
            <li>Did you <b>just </b>called Xercival?. <i>Passive</i></li>
            <p></p>

            <h6>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h6>
            <p>Examples :</p>
            <li>Zephyr <b>repaired </b>the car. <i>Active</i></li>
            <li>The car <b>was repaired </b>by Zephyr. <i>Passive</i></li>
